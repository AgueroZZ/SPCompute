## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Rewrite the title in the DESCRIPTION file, so its length is less than 65 characters (61 characters now).
* Rewrite the DESCRIPTION file so the description will not start with "This package", package name, title or similar.
* Replace "T" and "F" with "TRUE" and "FALSE" in all the codes.



## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.0.4
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.4
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results
